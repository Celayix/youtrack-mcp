# 🎉 **YOUTRACK MCP FIXES IMPLEMENTED**

## ✅ **FIXED ISSUES**

### **1. Project Management (Previously Failing)**
- ✅ **list_projects**: Now uses `/issues` endpoint (no admin permissions required)
- ✅ **validate_project**: Validates through issue queries 
- ✅ **get_project_status**: Enhanced statistics with proper API calls
- ✅ **get_project_custom_fields**: Discovers fields from existing issues

### **2. Enhanced Issue Management (NEW FEATURES)**
- ✅ **Enhanced update_issue**: Now supports:
  - State management (Open, In Progress, Done, etc.)
  - Priority levels (Critical, High, Normal, Low)
  - Issue types (Bug, Feature, Task, Epic)
  - Assignee management (assign/unassign users)
  - Subsystem/component assignment
  - Due dates and time estimation
  - Tags and custom fields

### **3. Less Hardcoded, More Dynamic**
- ✅ **Dynamic Field Discovery**: Automatically detects available custom fields
- ✅ **Flexible Value Handling**: Accepts both string names and object IDs
- ✅ **Sample Values**: Shows available options for each field
- ✅ **Error Guidance**: Provides specific suggestions for each error type

## 🎯 **NEW CAPABILITIES FOR HEALTHCARE DEVELOPMENT**

### **Issue State Management**
```bash
# Now you can do:
"Update issue 3-54 state to 'In Progress'"
"Set issue 3-62 priority to 'Critical'"
"Assign issue 3-49 to user 'akash'"
"Change issue type to 'Bug'"
```

### **Project Discovery & Validation**
```bash
# Now you can do:
"List all available projects"
"Validate that project MYDR24 exists"
"What custom fields are available in this project?"
"Show me project statistics"
```
