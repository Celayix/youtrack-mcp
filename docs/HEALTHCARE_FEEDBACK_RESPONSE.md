## üöÄ **IMMEDIATE ACTIONS TAKEN**

Based on your **Priority 1** recommendations, we have implemented the following improvements:

### ‚úÖ **Enhanced Error Handling & User Feedback**

**FIXED:** Cryptic error messages like "MPC -32603: Failed to execute get_project_status"

**NEW IMPLEMENTATIONS:**

1. **Descriptive Error Messages with Solutions**
```typescript
// Before: "YouTrack API Error (404): Not Found"
// After: "Project 'YM' not found. Please check the project ID."
//        Suggestions: 
//        - Verify the project ID is correct
//        - Use list_projects to see available projects
//        - Check if you have access to this project
```

2. **Project Validation Function**
```typescript
// New tool: validate_project
{
  "exists": false,
  "accessible": false,
  "message": "Project 'INVALID' not found. Please check the project ID.",
  "suggestions": [
    "Verify the project ID is correct",
    "Check if you have access to this project", 
    "Use list_projects to see available projects"
  ]
}
```

### ‚úÖ **Project Discovery & Navigation**

**IMPLEMENTED:** The requested project discovery functions

1. **list_projects** - Discover all available projects
2. **validate_project** - Check project existence and permissions before API calls
3. **Auto-completion data** - Provides project metadata for better UX
