## 🏗️ **Architecture Transformation**

### **Before** (Stubs/Mockups) ❌
```typescript
// Old stubbed implementation
private async assessScheduleRisks(_projectId: string): Promise<any[]> {
  return [{ 
    type: 'delayed_milestones', 
    severity: 3, 
    description: 'Some milestones may be at risk' // 🔴 FAKE DATA
  }];
}
```

### **After** (Production Implementation) ✅
```typescript
// New production implementation
private async assessScheduleRisks(projectId: string, issues: any[]): Promise<any[]> {
  const risks: any[] = [];
  const now = new Date();
  
  // 🟢 REAL ANALYSIS: Find overdue issues
  const overdueIssues = issues.filter(issue => {
    const dueDate = this.extractDueDate(issue);
    return dueDate && dueDate < now && !this.isCompleted(issue);
  });
  
  // 🟢 REAL METRICS: Calculate actual risk severity
  if (overdueIssues.length > 0) {
    risks.push({
      category: 'schedule',
      type: 'overdue_issues',
      severity: Math.min(5, Math.floor(overdueIssues.length / 5) + 3),
      description: `${overdueIssues.length} issues are overdue`,
      affectedIssues: overdueIssues.slice(0, 5).map(issue => issue.id),
    });
  }
  
  return risks; // 🟢 LIVE DATA from YouTrack
}
```
