# YouTrack MCP API Specification Compliance - COMPLETED ✅

## Summary

Successfully fixed all MCP tools to follow YouTrack API specifications as requested. The implementation now properly conforms to the official YouTrack OpenAPI 3.0.1 specification (version 2025.1).

## Key Fixes Applied

### 1. Custom Fields Handling ✅
- **Before**: Used incorrect `type` and `priority` direct properties  
- **After**: Implemented proper `ProjectCustomField` schema with field mapping
- **API Compliance**: Now uses `/admin/projects/{id}/customFields` endpoint

### 2. Issue Creation/Update ✅  
- **Before**: Direct field assignment that didn't follow API spec
- **After**: Proper custom fields array with `{name, value}` structure
- **Fallback**: Legacy method for environments without admin access

### 3. Project Management ✅
- **Before**: Limited project information retrieval
- **After**: Full project listing with `/admin/projects` endpoint
- **Enhancement**: Project validation and accessibility checks

### 4. Agile Boards Support ✅
- **API Endpoint**: `/agiles` for board listing
- **Features**: Board details, sprint management, issue assignment
- **Compliance**: Proper field parameter usage

### 5. Knowledge Base Integration ✅
- **API Endpoint**: `/articles` for knowledge base articles
- **Features**: Article CRUD operations, search, tagging
- **Compliance**: Proper content and metadata handling

### 6. Work Items Tracking ✅
- **API Endpoint**: `/issues/{id}/timeTracking/workItems`
- **Features**: Time logging, work item management
- **Compliance**: Proper duration format and user assignment
